An experiment in Rust, state machines, and graphs. And maybe also in creating games. Though at least one or two of those.

## Dependencies:

* rustc and cargo (most easily installed with rustup)

## To run

1. Install rustup
Run `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` to install

2. Set environment
(optional) run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`, or restart your terminal

3. Build
run `cargo build`

4. Execute binary
run `./target/debug/forth`

## Running tests
